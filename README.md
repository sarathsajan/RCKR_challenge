# RCKR hiring challenge

Find latitude and longitude of first 20 countries with a population greater than or equal to the population limit given below. Use the country details from [this dataset](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/apilayer/restcountries@3dc0fb110cd97bce9ddf27b3e8e1f7fbe115dc3c/src/main/resources/countriesV2.json).
Your task is to find the sum of the length of all lines (in kms) that can be drawn between co-ordinates of these countries.

* Assume radius of earth: 6371 km
* Round length of each line and final result to 2 decimal points
* If co-ordinates are missing for any country use 0.000 N 0.000 E

*Population limit: 1000*

*Note: Population limit will change at random intervals. So please make sure answer is computed for the correct population limit before submitting. Which means population limit can be a random number, could be 1000, 34252, 799, 2452477 etc*
